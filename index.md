# PROJECT EXPERIENCE

### Question and Answer System of Xinjiang Tourism over Knowledge Graph
This project aims at Xinjiang tourism, extracts knowledge triple from the Xinjiang tourism knowledge base we built, and constructs the
knowledge graph. Then to identify the entities in the question, generate sentence vectors, and match the most similar question templates. According to the semantics of the templates and the entities in the question, the answers are retrieved in the knowledge graph.

### Social Web Intelligence Analysis and User Identification Technology
The project mainly includes Social Web malicious user identification and location technology with given semantics, a portrait of multi- source Social Web platform users.

### Cross-lingual Multimodal Social Media Analysis
An Internet social web analysis system for minority languages over natural language processing, statistical machine learning, and cross- modal analysis technology.
